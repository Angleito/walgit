# Phase 2 Implementation Status

## Completed Modules

### 1. Object Cache (object_cache.move) ‚úÖ
- Multi-level caching (L1 hot, L2 warm)
- LRU eviction for L1
- TTL-based expiration for L2
- Cache statistics tracking
- **Known Limitations**: Table iteration requires production workarounds

### 2. Reference Index (reference_index.move) ‚úÖ
- Multiple lookup indices (by name, target, type, prefix)
- Symbolic reference resolution with cycle detection
- Prefix-based search optimization
- Metadata tracking for references

### 3. Batch Operations (batch_operations.move) ‚úÖ
- Support for batch blob/tree/commit/ref operations
- Dependency resolution and topological sorting
- Error handling with detailed results
- Operation validation

### 4. Performance Monitor (performance_monitor.move) ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive metric tracking
- Ring buffer storage pattern
- Statistical calculations (averages, percentiles)
- Real-time performance analysis

### 5. Benchmark Suite (benchmark.move) ‚úÖ
- Multiple test scenarios
- Cache stress testing
- Reference lookup benchmarks
- Batch operation testing
- Mixed workload simulation

## Critical Fixes Applied

1. **Import Issues**: Added missing Clock and TxContext imports
2. **Mutable Variables**: Fixed all immutable variable mutations
3. **Struct Access**: Created constructor functions for restricted structs
4. **Missing Features**: Added l2_evictions tracking and TTL expiration
5. **Type Safety**: Added proper copy abilities where needed
6. **Cycle Detection**: Implemented visited tracking for symbolic refs
7. **Test Infrastructure**: Created TestObject for valid ID generation

## Known Limitations

1. **Table Iteration**: Sui Move lacks table::keys function
   - Workaround: Maintain separate key tracking vectors
   - Impact: Simplified cache clearing and eviction

2. **Object ID Generation**: Test utilities require TxContext
   - Workaround: Create temporary test objects
   - Impact: More complex test setup

3. **Performance**: Some operations are simplified for Phase 2
   - Full implementations would require additional data structures

## Production Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Implement proper key tracking for tables
2. **Memory Management**: Add size limits and better eviction
3. **Persistence**: Consider upgrade paths and migration
4. **Monitoring**: Add production metrics and alerting

## Test Coverage Needed

1. L1/L2 cache interaction tests
2. Symbolic reference cycle tests
3. Batch operation dependency tests
4. Performance regression tests
5. Edge case handling tests

## Phase 3 Recommendations

1. **Garbage Collection**: Implement mark-and-sweep GC
2. **Shallow Clones**: Add partial repository cloning
3. **Submodules**: Support for nested repositories
4. **Advanced Caching**: Implement cache hierarchy optimization
5. **Network Optimization**: Add prefetching and predictive loading

## Validation Status

‚úÖ All Phase 2 modules compile successfully after fixes
‚úÖ Core functionality implemented according to spec
‚ö†Ô∏è Some features simplified due to Move constraints
üìù Production implementation notes documented

## Summary

Phase 2 successfully implements performance optimization features for WalGit, including multi-level caching, optimized lookups, batch operations, and comprehensive monitoring. While some features are simplified due to Move language constraints, the core functionality is complete and provides a solid foundation for Phase 3 enhancements.
