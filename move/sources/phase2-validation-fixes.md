# Phase 2 Validation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Imports
- Added missing `Clock` import in `batch_operations.move`
- Added missing `TxContext` import in `benchmark.move`

### 2. Mutable Variables
- Fixed all immutable variables that were being mutated:
  - In `performance_monitor.move`: Changed all counter variables to `mut`
  - In `benchmark.move`: Fixed `i` variable declarations
  - In `object_cache.move`: Fixed mutable variable declarations

### 3. Struct Visibility Issues
- Created constructor functions for `BatchOperation` and `OperationData`
- Added getter function `is_successful()` for `BatchResult`

### 4. Missing Fields and Abilities
- Added `l2_evictions` field to `CacheStats`
- Added `copy` ability to `CachedObject` and `CacheStats`
- Fixed initialization of `CacheStats` with all fields

### 5. L2 TTL Expiration
- Implemented expiration check and removal for L2 cache entries

### 6. Object ID Creation
- Fixed `object::new_id_from_bytes` errors by using proper test object creation
- Created `TestObject` struct for generating valid IDs in tests
- Updated all functions to pass `TxContext` for object creation

### 7. Table Iteration Issues
- Removed usage of non-existent `table::keys` function
- Added TODO comments for production implementation with key tracking
- Simplified implementations for Phase 2

### 8. Symbolic Reference Constants
- Defined `SYMBOLIC_REF` constant instead of using magic number 100

### 9. Cycle Detection
- Implemented proper cycle detection for symbolic references using visited tracking

## Remaining Issues

### In git_diff.move:
1. Fix struct declarations (need visibility modifiers)
2. Import missing types (`Repository`, `Commit`)
3. Fix unbound functions in git_repository and git_commit_object
4. Replace `for` loops with `while` loops (Move doesn't have for loops)
5. Remove usage of `table::keys`

## Code Changes Summary

1. **batch_operations.move**:
   - Added constructor functions for public instantiation
   - Added missing imports

2. **benchmark.move**:
   - Fixed all object ID creation
   - Added `TxContext` parameter propagation
   - Created `TestObject` for valid ID generation

3. **object_cache.move**:
   - Added missing fields and abilities
   - Fixed mutable variable declarations
   - Removed table::keys usage

4. **reference_index.move**:
   - Added `SYMBOLIC_REF` constant
   - Implemented cycle detection

5. **performance_monitor.move**:
   - Fixed all mutable variable declarations

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation errors in git_diff.move
2. Create comprehensive tests for Phase 2 features
3. Document production implementation requirements for:
   - Proper L2 cache key tracking
   - Full cache clearing functionality
   - Complete L2 eviction implementation
