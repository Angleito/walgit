# WalGit Smart Contract Security Audit

## Introduction

This document presents the findings of a security audit conducted on the WalGit smart contracts. The audit focuses on identifying potential vulnerabilities, security risks, and recommending mitigations to enhance the overall security posture of the system.

## Scope

The audit covered the following Move modules:
- `walgit.move` - Main entry point
- `git_repository.move` - Repository management
- `storage.move` - Basic storage quota management
- `enhanced_storage.move` - Advanced storage allocation system
- `git_blob_object.move` - Blob storage
- `git_commit_object.move` - Commit representation
- `git_tree_object.move` - Tree structure

## Summary of Findings

| Severity | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | 0 | Issues that can lead to immediate loss of funds or complete system compromise |
| High | 3 | Issues that can lead to significant loss of funds or significant system disruption |
| Medium | 5 | Issues that can lead to limited loss of funds or temporary system disruption |
| Low | 4 | Issues that don't pose an immediate threat but should be addressed |
| Informational | 6 | Best practice recommendations |

## Critical Findings

No critical vulnerabilities were identified.

## High Severity Findings

### H-01: Integer Overflow in Storage Cost Calculation

**Location:** `enhanced_storage.move` (Lines 244-246)

**Description:** The cost calculation for custom allocations can potentially overflow for large values of `size_gb` and `duration_days`. This could lead to incorrect pricing and potential economic attacks.

```move
let base_cost = size_gb * CUSTOM_COST_PER_GB;
let duration_multiplier = (duration_days as u64) / 30;  // Cost per month
let cost = base_cost * duration_multiplier;
```

**Recommendation:** Use checked arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and add upper bounds for `size_gb` and `duration_days`.

```move
assert!(size_gb <= 1000, EInvalidAllocationSize); // Max 1000 GB
assert!(duration_days <= 3650, EInvalidDuration); // Max 10 years

let base_cost = size_gb * CUSTOM_COST_PER_GB;
assert!(base_cost / CUSTOM_COST_PER_GB == size_gb, EIntegerOverflow); // Check for overflow

let duration_multiplier = (duration_days as u64) / 30;  // Cost per month
assert!(duration_multiplier > 0, EInvalidDuration); // Ensure at least 1 month

let cost = base_cost * duration_multiplier;
assert!(cost / duration_multiplier == base_cost, EIntegerOverflow); // Check for overflow
```

### H-02: Unrestricted Access to Update Storage Usage

**Location:** `enhanced_storage.move` (Lines 441-473)

**Description:** The `update_storage_usage` function doesn't verify that the caller has appropriate permissions to modify the storage usage for a repository. This allows any user to update the storage usage of any repository, potentially causing denial of service.

**Recommendation:** Add authorization checks to ensure only repository owners or authorized collaborators can update storage usage.

### H-03: Lack of Treasury Withdrawal Controls

**Location:** `storage.move` and `enhanced_storage.move`

**Description:** While the treasury collects payments for storage, there's no mechanism to withdraw funds or manage the treasury. This could lead to locked funds in the treasury.

**Recommendation:** Implement a secure withdrawal mechanism with appropriate access controls for treasury management.

## Medium Severity Findings

### M-01: Insufficient Validation in Credit Calculation

**Location:** `enhanced_storage.move` (Lines 395-399)

**Description:** The calculation of credit for unused time during tier upgrades uses unsafe arithmetic operations and doesn't account for potential precision losses.

**Recommendation:** Use checked arithmetic and ensure precision is handled correctly.

### M-02: No Expiration Handling for Auto-Renew

**Location:** `enhanced_storage.move`

**Description:** The code tracks whether allocations should auto-renew (`auto_renew` flag), but there's no implementation to actually handle auto-renewal when allocations expire.

**Recommendation:** Implement a mechanism to auto-renew allocations or remove the flag if not used.

### M-03: Missing Storage Reclamation

**Location:** `storage.move`

**Description:** When storage is consumed, there's no mechanism to reclaim storage when files are deleted or repositories are removed.

**Recommendation:** Implement a storage reclamation system to allow users to free up their quota.

### M-04: Insufficient Repository Deletion Handling

**Location:** `git_repository.move`

**Description:** There's no mechanism to properly delete repositories and clean up associated resources, which could lead to orphaned storage allocations.

**Recommendation:** Implement a repository deletion function that properly cleans up all associated resources.

### M-05: Improper Error Reuse

**Location:** `storage.move` (Line 72)

**Description:** The error code `EInsufficientFunds` is reused for an ownership check, which can lead to confusing error messages.

```move
// Ensure the transaction sender is the owner of the StorageQuota object.
assert!(storage.owner == owner, EInsufficientFunds); // Re-using EInsufficientFunds for ownership check
```

**Recommendation:** Define a specific error code for ownership checks.

## Low Severity Findings

### L-01: Inadequate Event Emission

**Location:** Throughout the codebase

**Description:** Some important state changes don't emit events, making it harder to track and audit system activity.

**Recommendation:** Emit events for all significant state changes.

### L-02: Missing Input Validation

**Location:** Various functions

**Description:** Some functions don't validate inputs sufficiently, potentially allowing invalid states.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive input validation for all public functions.

### L-03: Missing Docstrings

**Location:** Throughout the codebase

**Description:** Many functions lack proper documentation, making the code harder to understand and audit.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and structs.

### L-04: Hardcoded Constants

**Location:** `storage.move` and `enhanced_storage.move`

**Description:** Storage pricing and tier values are hardcoded, making it difficult to update them without redeploying the contracts.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a configurable parameter system.

## Informational Findings

### I-01: Consider Using Decimals for Financial Calculations

**Description:** Financial calculations are done with integer arithmetic, which may lead to rounding errors.

**Recommendation:** Consider using a decimal representation for financial calculations.

### I-02: Transaction Simulation for Cost Estimates

**Description:** Users may not know the exact cost of operations before executing them.

**Recommendation:** Implement "view" functions that simulate transactions to provide cost estimates.

### I-03: Implement Formal Verification

**Description:** Critical functions lack formal verification.

**Recommendation:** Consider using the Move Prover to formally verify critical functions.

### I-04: Consider Storage Compaction

**Description:** As repositories grow, they may accumulate fragmented storage.

**Recommendation:** Implement storage compaction mechanisms to optimize storage usage.

### I-05: Rate Limiting

**Description:** There's no rate limiting to prevent abuse of the system.

**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations.

### I-06: Standardize Permission Checks

**Description:** Permission checks are implemented inconsistently across different modules.

**Recommendation:** Standardize permission checking logic and consider implementing a centralized access control system.

## Recommendations Summary

1. Implement checked arithmetic operations for all financial calculations
2. Add proper authorization checks for all sensitive operations
3. Implement a treasury management system
4. Add storage reclamation functionality
5. Improve event emission for better auditability
6. Enhance input validation
7. Add comprehensive documentation
8. Consider making pricing and constants configurable
9. Implement formal verification for critical functions

## Conclusion

The WalGit smart contracts demonstrate a solid foundation for a decentralized Git system. While several security issues were identified, most can be addressed with the recommended mitigations. After implementing these changes, a follow-up audit is recommended to ensure all vulnerabilities have been properly addressed.

## Responsible Disclosure

This audit was conducted as part of an internal security review process. The findings and recommendations are to be addressed before deployment to a production environment.
