</p>

## Overview

WalGit is a decentralized, user-controlled version control system built on Sui blockchain and Walrus's distributed storage technology. It empowers developers to maintain full sovereignty over their code while enjoying the benefits of cloud-based collaboration.

## CLI Commands

WalGit provides a comprehensive set of commands for version control:

### Core Commands
- `walgit init [--encryption]` - Initialize a new repository (optionally with encryption)
- `walgit add <files>` - Stage files for commit
- `walgit commit -m <message>` - Create a new commit
- `walgit push` - Push commits to remote
- `walgit pull` - Pull changes from remote
- `walgit clone <repo>` - Clone a repository
- `walgit status` - Show repository status
- `walgit log` - Show commit history

### Encryption Commands (Seal Integration)
- `walgit encryption enable` - Enable encryption for repository
- `walgit encryption disable` - Disable encryption
- `walgit encryption share <user>` - Share access with a user
- `walgit encryption revoke <user>` - Revoke user access
- `walgit encryption list-access` - List users with access
- `walgit encryption rotate-keys` - Rotate encryption keys

### Storage Commands (Tusky Integration)
- `walgit tusky config` - Configure Tusky storage
- `walgit tusky use` - Use Tusky as primary storage
- `walgit tusky status` - Check storage usage and quota
- `walgit tusky migrate` - Migrate existing blobs to Tusky
- `walgit tusky fallback` - Set fallback storage provider

## Enhanced Integrations

### Sui Blockchain
- Content-addressable storage with SHA-256 hashing
- Immutable blob ID references
- Gas-optimized transactions with batching
- BlobIdRegistry for efficient blob management

### Walrus Storage
- RedStuff erasure coding (3/7 configuration)
- Chunked uploads for large files (up to 14GB)
- Parallel operations for better performance
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Seal Encryption
- Threshold encryption (customizable, e.g., 2-of-3)
- End-to-end encryption for private repositories
- Key share management for team collaboration
- Automatic key rotation support

### Tusky Storage
- Free tier: 5GB personal / 50GB WalGit shared
- Automatic fallback to Walrus when quota exceeded
- Seamless migration between storage providers
- Cost-effective storage for open source projects

## Testing

To run the tests for the WalGit CLI:

```bash
cd walgit-backend
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite uses Jest and includes mocks for Sui and Walrus integration to ensure all CLI commands work properly without requiring actual blockchain interaction.

## Local Git Tree Simulation

You can test the basic local commit and push functionality without connecting to the network by using a simulated Git repository structure.

1.  Create a test directory and initialize a local WalGit repository:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p test-repo/.walgit
    cd test-repo
    ```

2.  Create some files and directories within `test-repo`:

    ```bash
    echo "This is the first file." > file1.txt
    mkdir src
    echo "console.log('Hello, WalGit!');" > src/main.js
    ```

3.  Run the local WalGit commit command from within the `test-repo` directory using `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx walgit commit -m "Initial local commit"
    ```

    This will create a simplified Git object structure (commit, tree, and blob files) within the `.walgit` directory.

4.  Run the local WalGit push command from within the `test-repo` directory using `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx walgit push
    ```

    This will simulate a push operation and confirm the latest local commit.

## Why WalGit?

> "Developers should not have to choose between the convenience of cloud-hosted version control and the sovereignty of their own code."

The increasing centralization of code hosting platforms like GitHub‚Äînow under Microsoft's control‚Äîraises concerns about:
- Data privacy
- Code ownership
- Unauthorized use of open source contributions to train proprietary AI models

WalGit addresses these challenges by leveraging Walrus's decentralized storage capabilities to provide a self-hosted, git-like version control system. With WalGit, developers own their repositories and manage their storage through a decentralized cloud, ensuring both autonomy and security.

## Key Features

### üåê Decentralized Storage
WalGit utilizes Walrus's distributed cloud storage with RedStuff erasure coding, allowing users to host their code on infrastructure they control, rather than relying on a single centralized provider. Large files up to 14GB are supported with chunked uploads.

### üîê Self-Ownership and Control
Users retain full ownership of their repositories, including how and where their data is stored and who can access it. Integration with Sui blockchain ensures content-addressable storage with immutable references.

### üìñ Open Source and Transparent
WalGit is fully open source, ensuring transparency and community-driven development. Anyone can audit, contribute to, or deploy the platform.

### üõ°Ô∏è End-to-End Encryption
Code is protected using Seal's threshold encryption and native wallet-based encryption, providing robust security for sensitive projects and intellectual property. Supports customizable encryption thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3 shares) for team collaboration.

### üí∞ Affordable and Accessible
By leveraging Walrus's cost-effective storage and integrating with Tusky's free tier (5GB personal, 50GB WalGit shared), WalGit offers a scalable solution for individuals and teams without the high costs of traditional cloud services.

### üîÑ Familiar Git-Like Experience
WalGit maintains a workflow and interface similar to GitHub, making it easy for developers to transition without sacrificing usability or productivity. Uses 'walgit' command prefix for all operations.

### üé® Customizable User Experience
WalGit offers a fully customizable interface with theme switching (light/dark mode and accent colors), guided tours, and an intuitive onboarding process for new users.

### üöÄ Enhanced Performance
Features parallel operations, batch processing, automatic retries, and storage provider fallback mechanisms for optimal performance and reliability.
