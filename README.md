## Overview

WalGit is a decentralized, user-controlled version control system built on Sui blockchain and Walrus's distributed storage technology. It empowers developers to maintain full sovereignty over their code while enjoying the benefits of cloud-based collaboration.

## Testing

To run the tests for the WalGit CLI:

```bash
cd WalGit-Backend
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite uses Jest and includes mocks for Sui and Walrus integration to ensure all CLI commands work properly without requiring actual blockchain interaction.

## Local Git Tree Simulation

You can test the basic local commit and push functionality without connecting to the network by using a simulated Git repository structure.

1.  Create a test directory and initialize a local WalGit repository:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p test-repo/.walgit
    cd test-repo
    ```

2.  Create some files and directories within `test-repo`:

    ```bash
    echo "This is the first file." > file1.txt
    mkdir src
    echo "console.log('Hello, WalGit!');" > src/main.js
    ```

3.  Run the local WalGit commit command from within the `test-repo` directory using `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx walgit commit -m "Initial local commit"
    ```

    This will create a simplified Git object structure (commit, tree, and blob files) within the `.walgit` directory.

4.  Run the local WalGit push command from within the `test-repo` directory using `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx walgit push
    ```

    This will simulate a push operation and confirm the latest local commit.

## Why WalGit?

> "Developers should not have to choose between the convenience of cloud-hosted version control and the sovereignty of their own code."

The increasing centralization of code hosting platforms like GitHub‚Äînow under Microsoft's control‚Äîraises concerns about:
- Data privacy
- Code ownership
- Unauthorized use of open source contributions to train proprietary AI models

WalGit addresses these challenges by leveraging Walrus's decentralized storage capabilities to provide a self-hosted, git-like version control system. With WalGit, developers own their repositories and manage their storage through a decentralized cloud, ensuring both autonomy and security.

## Key Features

### üåê Decentralized Storage
WalGit utilizes Walrus's distributed cloud storage, allowing users to host their code on infrastructure they control, rather than relying on a single centralized provider.

### üîê Self-Ownership and Control
Users retain full ownership of their repositories, including how and where their data is stored and who can access it.

### üìñ Open Source and Transparent
WalGit is fully open source, ensuring transparency and community-driven development. Anyone can audit, contribute to, or deploy the platform.

### üõ°Ô∏è End-to-End Encryption
Code is protected using Seal's encryption and native wallet-based encryption, providing robust security for sensitive projects and intellectual property.

### üí∞ Affordable and Accessible
By leveraging Walrus's cost-effective and widely available storage, WalGit offers a scalable solution for individuals and teams without the high costs of traditional cloud services.

### üîÑ Familiar Git-Like Experience
WalGit maintains a workflow and interface similar to GitHub, making it easy for developers to transition without sacrificing usability or productivity.

- Sui wallet (Sui Wallet, Ethos Wallet, or other compatible wallets)
- Access to Walrus storage
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository and submodules
git clone https://github.com/Angleito/walgit.git --recursive
cd walgit

# Install root dependencies
npm install
