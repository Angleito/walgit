# Git vs WalGit: A Comparison

This document compares traditional Git with WalGit, highlighting key similarities and differences between the two version control systems.

## Conceptual Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Git | WalGit |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Centralized repositories with distributed copies | Fully decentralized on blockchain with distributed storage |
| **Trust Model** | Trust in central hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) | Trustless, cryptographically verified by blockchain |
| **Data Storage** | Local filesystem for all repository data | Hybrid: Sui blockchain for structure, Walrus for content |
| **Authentication** | Username/password or SSH keys | Blockchain wallet and signatures |
| **Immutability** | Can rewrite history (force push) | Immutable history secured by blockchain |
| **Availability** | Depends on central server uptime | Decentralized, highly available |
| **Ownership** | Repository "owned" by account on hosting platform | True ownership via blockchain account |

## Core Concepts Mapping

| Git Concept | WalGit Implementation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Blob** | `GitBlobObject` on Sui + Content in Walrus |
| **Tree** | `GitTreeObject` on Sui |
| **Commit** | `GitCommitObject` on Sui |
| **Repository** | `GitRepository` object on Sui |
| **Branch** | Reference stored in `GitRepository.branches` |
| **Tag** | Reference stored in `GitRepository.tags` |
| **Remote** | Blockchain address of repository |
| **HEAD** | Reference stored in `GitRepository.head_commit_id` |

## Command Comparison

| Git Command | WalGit Command | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `git init` | `walgit init` | Creates repository on blockchain |
| `git clone` | `walgit clone` | Downloads repository structure from blockchain |
| `git add` | `walgit add` | Uploads content to Walrus, stages in local index |
| `git commit` | `walgit commit` | Creates new objects on blockchain |
| `git checkout` | `walgit checkout` | Downloads content from Walrus based on tree |
| `git branch` | `walgit branch` | Updates branch reference on blockchain |
| `git merge` | `walgit merge` | Creates merge commit on blockchain |
| `git push` | N/A | Commits directly update blockchain |
| `git pull` | `walgit pull` | Updates local state from blockchain |

## Technical Differences

### Data Storage

**Git:**
- All repository data (blobs, trees, commits) stored in `.git/objects`
- Data stored as compressed files in local filesystem
- Remote repositories store identical copies

**WalGit:**
- Repository structure (trees, commits) stored on Sui blockchain
- File content (blobs) stored in Walrus decentralized storage
- Local `.walgit` directory caches blockchain and storage data

### Authentication & Authorization

**Git:**
- Authentication via username/password or SSH keys
- Authorization managed by hosting provider
- Repository permissions configured on server

**WalGit:**
- Authentication via blockchain wallet
- Authorization enforced by Move smart contracts
- Repository access control defined in `GitRepository` object

### Network Operations

**Git:**
- Push/pull operations sync with central repository
- Operations done via HTTP or SSH protocols
- Network partitions can prevent collaboration

**WalGit:**
- Commits are transactions on Sui blockchain
- Blockchain consensus ensures data consistency
- As long as blockchain is accessible, repository is available

### Performance Considerations

**Git:**
- Fast local operations
- Network operations depend on server connection
- Repository size affects clone time

**WalGit:**
- Local caching improves read performance
- Blockchain transactions have finality delay
- Gas costs increase with commit frequency and complexity

## Advantages of WalGit

1. **True Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
2. **Cryptographic Verification**: All operations cryptographically signed and verified
3. **Immutable History**: Commit history cannot be altered once confirmed
4. **Ownership**: True ownership of repositories via blockchain
5. **Access Control**: Granular, programmable access control via smart contracts
6. **Transparency**: All operations visible and verifiable on blockchain
7. **Storage Persistence**: Content stored with guaranteed persistence in Walrus

## Limitations of WalGit

1. **Transaction Costs**: Blockchain operations incur gas fees
2. **Performance**: Blockchain operations have higher latency than local Git
3. **Storage Costs**: Paying for Walrus storage upfront
4. **Complexity**: More components (blockchain, wallets, storage)
5. **Tooling Ecosystem**: Less mature ecosystem than Git

## Use Cases

**Ideal for WalGit:**
- Open source projects requiring high transparency
- Projects with strict compliance and audit requirements
- Collaborative efforts requiring trustless verification
- Digital assets with ownership verification requirements

**Better for Traditional Git:**
- Private development with high commit frequency
- Very large repositories with frequent changes
- Projects with existing Git-based workflows
- Environments with limited internet connectivity

## Future Directions

1. **Performance Optimizations**: Improve local caching and operation batching
2. **IDE Integrations**: Plugins for VS Code, JetBrains, etc.
3. **Merge Strategies**: Advanced merge resolution mechanisms
4. **Governance**: DAO-based repository governance
5. **Enhanced Privacy**: Selective disclosure of repository content
