## Implementation Tips for Junior Engineers

### Move Development Tips

1. **Resource Safety**
   - Be careful with resource handling in Move
   - Resources can't be copied or discarded, only moved or stored
   - Use appropriate abilities (`key`, `store`, etc.) for your structs

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write tests before implementing complex logic
   - Use Sui's Move testing framework
   - Test edge cases carefully, especially around authorization

3. **Gas Optimization**
   - Minimize on-chain storage
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Be mindful of computational complexity

### Client Development Tips

1. **Error Handling**
   - Blockchain operations can fail for many reasons
   - Implement robust error handling and recovery
   - Provide clear error messages to users

2. **Asynchronous Programming**
   - Most operations are asynchronous
   - Use async/await patterns consistently
   - Be careful with error propagation in async code

3. **Local State Management**
   - Keep the local state in sync with blockchain
   - Implement reliable caching mechanisms
   - Handle conflicts between local and blockchain state

## Deployment Checklist

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Pre-deployment Verification**
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Security review completed
   - [ ] Gas costs analyzed and optimized

2. **Deployment Process**
   - [ ] Deploy to Sui testnet for final testing
   - [ ] Verify deployed package ID and objects
   - [ ] Deploy to Sui mainnet

### Client Deployment

1. **Package Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare npm package
   - [ ] Include comprehensive documentation
   - [ ] Set up continuous integration

2. **Distribution**
   - [ ] Publish to npm registry
   - [ ] Create installation instructions
   - [ ] Set up update mechanism
