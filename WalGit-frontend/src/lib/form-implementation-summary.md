# React Hook Form Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of React Hook Form with Zod validation across the WalGit application.

## Components Created/Updated

### Form Schemas

Added a centralized form schema file (`/src/lib/form-schemas.ts`) containing:

- `repositorySchema`: For repository creation
- `repositoryWizardSchema`: For the multi-step repository wizard
- `pullRequestSchema`: For pull request creation
- `commentSchema`: For comments in code reviews
- `reviewSchema`: For pull request reviews

### Form Components

1. **FormContainer** (`/src/components/ui/form-container.tsx`):
   - A reusable container for forms that handles submission logic
   - Type-safe with generic types for different form schemas

2. **CommentForm** (`/src/components/code-review/CommentForm.tsx`):
   - Reusable comment form with validation
   - Used in code reviews and pull request comments

3. **ReviewForm** (`/src/components/code-review/ReviewForm.tsx`):
   - Form for submitting pull request reviews with different verdict options
   - Uses radio group for selection of review type

### Updated Components

1. **Repository Creation Form** (`/src/app/new-repository/page.tsx`):
   - Migrated to React Hook Form with Zod validation
   - Improved error handling and validation feedback

2. **Repository Wizard** (`/src/components/repository/RepositoryWizard.tsx`):
   - Updated to use React Hook Form for multi-step form validation
   - Each step has its own validation logic

3. **Pull Request Creation** (`/src/app/repositories/[owner]/[repo]/pulls/new/page.tsx`):
   - Implemented form validation for pull request creation
   - Added branch selection validation

4. **Review Thread** (`/src/components/code-review/ReviewThread.tsx`):
   - Updated to use the new CommentForm component
   - Improved validation for comment replies

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Validation**: All forms now have consistent validation through Zod schemas
2. **Type Safety**: Form data is fully typed throughout the application
3. **Better User Experience**: Immediate feedback on validation errors
4. **Code Reusability**: Common form components can be reused across the application
5. **Simplified Maintenance**: Centralized schema definitions make updating validation rules easier

## Future Improvements

1. **Form Persistence**: Add form persistence for long forms to prevent data loss
2. **Field-Level Validation**: Implement more granular field-level validation where needed
3. **Accessibility**: Continue to improve form accessibility features
4. **Form Analytics**: Add analytics to track form completion rates and common errors
