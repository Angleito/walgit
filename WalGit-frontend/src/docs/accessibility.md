# WalGit Accessibility Guidelines

WalGit is committed to creating an inclusive application that can be used by everyone, regardless of abilities or disabilities. This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the application and provides guidance for maintaining and improving accessibility.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Skip to Main Content**: A skip link allows keyboard users to bypass navigation menus and jump directly to the main content
- **Focus Management**: Focus trapping is implemented in modals, dialogs, and other interactive components 
- **Focus Indicators**: All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Common actions can be performed using keyboard shortcuts

### Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper ARIA roles, states, and properties are used throughout the application
- **Live Announcements**: Important state changes and dynamic content updates are announced to screen readers
- **Meaningful Alternative Text**: All images have descriptive alt text
- **Form Labels**: All form inputs have proper labels and are associated with their descriptions

### Semantic HTML

- **Proper Heading Structure**: Content follows a logical heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- **Landmark Regions**: Page sections are marked with appropriate landmark roles (main, nav, etc.)
- **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 semantic elements are used where appropriate (section, article, nav, etc.)
- **Enhanced Forms**: Form fields have proper labels, validation, and error messaging

### Color and Contrast

- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Color Independence**: Information is not conveyed by color alone
- **Dark Mode Support**: Fully supported dark mode with appropriate contrast in both themes

### Responsive Design

- **Responsive Layout**: Application is usable at various viewport sizes
- **Text Resizing**: Interface works properly when text is enlarged up to 200%
- **Touch Targets**: Interactive elements have appropriate size for touch interfaces

## Component-Specific Implementations

### Buttons and Interactive Elements

- All buttons have proper roles, labels, and states
- Loading states are properly announced
- Disabled states are visually indicated and include proper ARIA attributes

### Forms and Inputs

- All form fields have associated labels
- Required fields are marked both visually and via aria-required
- Error messages are linked to inputs using aria-errormessage
- Form validation includes descriptive error messages

### Modals and Dialogs

- Focus is trapped within modal dialogs
- ESC key can be used to close dialogs
- Dialogs have proper ARIA roles and attributes
- Background content is inert when dialogs are open

### Navigation and Menus

- Keyboard navigation supports arrow keys for menu items
- Current page is indicated in navigation via aria-current
- Dropdown menus are accessible via keyboard
- Expandable sections use proper aria-expanded states

### Tables and Data

- Data tables use proper table semantics
- Tables include appropriate headers and scope attributes
- Complex tables use aria-describedby for additional context
- Sortable columns indicate current sort direction

## Testing Methodology

- **Automated Testing**: Components are tested with jest-axe for common accessibility issues
- **Keyboard Testing**: All features are verified to work with keyboard-only navigation
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Application is tested with popular screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- **Contrast Checking**: Design system colors are verified for appropriate contrast ratios

## Accessibility Hooks and Utilities

The application includes several reusable accessibility utilities:

- `useFocusTrap`: Manages focus within a specific container
- `useKeyboardNavigation`: Handles keyboard interaction for lists, menus, etc.
- `announce`: Creates screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
- `ariaAttributes`: Helper functions to generate proper ARIA attribute sets

## Future Improvements

- Implement more comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Add reduced motion preferences for animations
- Enhance form error handling with more descriptive messages
- Improve accessibility of code syntax highlighting in repository views
- Add additional language support for internationalization
