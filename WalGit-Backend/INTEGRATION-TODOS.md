# WalGit Backend Integration TODOs

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Blob Management**
   - Create `/utils/blob-manager.js` for tracking and handling Git blob objects
   - Implement content addressing and deduplication
   - Add content streaming for large files
   - Create helpers for blob verification

2. **Create Configuration Module**
   - Develop `/utils/walrus-config.js` for storage configuration
   - Add network-specific settings (devnet, testnet, mainnet)
   - Implement environment variable integration
   - Create schema for configuration validation

3. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Create `/utils/error-handler.js` with specific error classes
   - Add fallback strategies for service unavailability
   - Implement simulation capabilities
   - Develop user-friendly error messages

4. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Write tests for Walrus upload/download
   - Test commit/push/pull with blockchain
   - Create simulation tests for offline development
   - Add transaction failure tests

5. **Update CLI Commands**
   - Update command modules to use new utilities
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Implement detailed error reporting
   - Add blockchain/Walrus status checks

6. **Complete Core Git Operations**
   - Finalize implementation of branch management
   - Complete merge operation
   - Implement stash functionality
   - Add interactive rebase support

## Integration Steps

1. **Test Components Independently**
   - Test Walrus integration in isolation
   - Validate transaction utilities with mock blockchain
   - Verify tree builder with test data

2. **Test Complete Workflows**
   - Test full commit → push → pull cycle
   - Verify content integrity across operations
   - Test with various file sizes and types

3. **Deploy and Test on Testnet**
   - Deploy smart contracts to Sui testnet
   - Configure backend to use testnet
   - Verify operations with live blockchain

4. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions
   - Create usage examples
   - Document configuration options
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add parallel processing for large file uploads
   - Implement content chunking for large files
   - Add compression options

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add content encryption options
   - Implement more robust authentication
   - Add access control features

3. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Handle large repositories efficiently
   - Optimize for reduced gas costs
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
