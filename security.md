## Smart Contract Security

### Security Measures
- **Access Controls**: Strict permissions on repository operations
- **Transaction Verification**: Multi-step verification for critical operations
- **Storage Quotas**: Enforced limits on repository size to prevent denial-of-service
- **Object Capabilities**: Sui Move's object-centric security model for safe resource management
- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions validated using Sui Move Prover

### Audit Findings and Remediations
- **Resource Management**: All resources properly created and dropped with no leakage
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: All arithmetic operations use checked math to prevent overflow
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Function-level locks to prevent reentrancy attacks
- **Authorization Checks**: Authority verification before modifying repository state

## Backend CLI Security

### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated using the following principles:
- Strict type checking and sanitization
- Parameter bounds verification
- Path traversal prevention (blocking `../` sequences)
- Command injection protection with parameter scrubbing
- Content validation against expected schemas

### Implementation
Input validation has been added to all command modules with validation rules appropriate to each command's parameters:
- Repository paths: Sanitized to prevent traversal and checked for validity
- Commit IDs: Verified for format and existence
- Branch names: Validated against Git branch naming rules
- File paths: Checked for traversal attempts and sanitized

## Rate Limiting

### API Endpoints
Rate limiting has been implemented to protect API endpoints from abuse:
- **Authentication Endpoints**: 5 requests per minute per IP
- **Repository Operations**: 30 requests per minute per authenticated user
- **Read Operations**: 60 requests per minute per authenticated user

### Implementation Details
- Token bucket algorithm for smooth rate limiting
- Configurable limits based on environment (development/production)
- Rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-*)
- Graceful handling of rate limit errors with clear user feedback

## Authentication and Authorization

### Wallet Authentication
- Sui wallet signatures for secure authentication
- JWT tokens for session management with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation to prevent token reuse
- CSRF protection for all authenticated requests

### Permission Model
- Repository-based permission system
- Role-based access control (Owner, Contributor, Reader)
- Fine-grained permissions for repository operations
- Two-factor authentication for critical operations

## Data Handling and Privacy

### Data Storage
- Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- Walrus storage integration with encrypted blobs
- Minimal personal data collection
- Configurable data retention policies

### Privacy Considerations
- Clear data usage policies in Terms of Service
- User controls for data sharing
- Compliance with relevant privacy regulations
- Data minimization principles applied throughout

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. Detection and reporting mechanisms
2. Containment and evidence collection procedures
3. Analysis and remediation steps
4. Post-incident review and improvements

### Responsible Disclosure
- Clear process for reporting vulnerabilities
- Bug bounty program details
- Communication protocols for security issues
- Response time commitments

## Security Audit Results

Regular security audits are conducted with the following focus areas:

### Code Review
- Static analysis findings and remediations
- Dynamic analysis results
- Penetration testing outcomes

### Infrastructure Security
- Network security measures
- Deployment security
- CI/CD pipeline security controls
- Dependency management and vulnerability scanning

This security documentation is a living document that will be updated as new security measures are implemented or as the threat landscape evolves.
